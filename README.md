# 7-Day Postdoctoral Technical Challenge  
## AI Medical Imaging, Visual Language Models, and Semantic Retrieval

This repository contains my submission for the 7-Day Postdoctoral Technical Challenge at AlfaisalX: Cognitive Robotics and Autonomous Agents.

The project implements an end-to-end AI prototype system using PneumoniaMNIST (MedMNIST v2) combining:

- CNN-based pneumonia classification
- Visual Language Model (VLM) medical report generation
- Qualitative cross-model analysis
